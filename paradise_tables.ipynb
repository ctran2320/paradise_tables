    "Now let's dive into the actual profitability of our business. We join our Orders table with our Ingriedients, Supplies Used, Overhead, and labor table to grab all of our total revenue and cost per order. We calculate our supply cost by dividing the total number of supplies used divided by the average expense I've spent to purchase those supplies, the total ingredient cost per order, and the labor cost if there were any for paying anybody who assisted me in making the orders. We have a final profit column which subtracts all of the costs I've just mentioned from the total revenue for that order. This does not 100% represent true profits per order as there are some supplies I don't take into account when entering data such as stickers used and this does not take into account all of the start up costs I've spent. However, this helps me know how profitable my business is after I've officially launched and how much profit I've realized per order."
