# Paradise Tables - Dessert Catering Business
## Tableau Dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charlie.tran3526/viz/paradise_tables/OverallPerformance

## Background/Goal:
Last August of 2022, I started a dessert catering side-business that I do on the weekends to make extra money on the side and have something fun I can do on the weekends! I've had many orders since then, sold thousands of dessert cups and various other items and have made decent money that offsets a lot of monthly spending so I can save most of my salary from my W-2 job. I created a Tableau Dashboard to track my performance in terms of profit, revenue, number of orders and can let me see any trends or if I'm meeting my goals. It also provides useful information about my best selling items and my highest expense items for ingredients and supplies, which tells me which flavors I can recommend people when they ask for recommendations or offer deals on those items. I can also look for deals/coupons on my expensive ingredients/supplies or look for places to buy in bulk. 

I also wanted to practice my SQL knowledge/ability and answer 10 questions that a potential manager/business owner may ask of me. In this case, I'm my own boss so I explored questions that seemed interesting to me and answered them via SQL & Python.

## Data

## Analysis
Tableau Dashboard:
1. Overall Performance: Header items are used to track overall performance such as total revenue, profit, expenses, number of orders and the current month's progress. I visualize a 3 month look back which can be extended farther back in time and can look at trends or months that do/don't meet my goals. My order breakdown table helps me visualize profit, revenue and cost per order and how many hours I spend and highlights which orders have the highest profit/hours spent ratio. 
2. Breakdown


## Future Work
I believe this tool will be more useful as time goes on and I collect more data and have a more robust dataset that spans more than just several months. I hope to implement forecasting techniques to plan for potential future orders, cluster my customers by buying behavior to visualize which types of customers I have and my most profitable ones which can help me cater more towards that audience and perhaps also track my marketing actions when I post on Facebook and Instagram to analyze my highest-reaching posts.
